# From Salaries to Outcomes: The Mindset Shift Leaders Need When AI Agents Join the Workforce

*By Nathan Knittel — Head of Technology, The Agency | Founder, KNIC Ventures*

For over a century, the economics of business have been governed by a single, deeply ingrained equation: value equals time multiplied by cost per hour. We hire people, we pay them salaries, and we measure their contribution through the lens of 40-hour weeks and annual compensation. It's a model so embedded in our thinking that most executives don't even realise it's a model at all — it's simply how work gets done.

Agentic AI is about to break that equation entirely.

As someone who has spent the last 15 years building technology for the real estate industry, and who now leads a team deploying AI agents that work alongside nearly 900 staff members, I can tell you that the shift isn't coming. It's here. And the organisations that thrive will be the ones whose leaders adopt a fundamentally different way of thinking about work, cost, and value.

## The Employee Model: Value as a Function of Time

Let's start with what we know.

When you hire an employee at $80,000 per year, you're buying roughly 2,080 hours of their time. That works out to about $38.50 per hour. Whether they're having a productive day or a slow one, whether they're in deep flow or stuck in back-to-back meetings, the cost remains fixed. Efficiency, in this model, is about maximising the output you extract from those purchased hours.

This framework has shaped everything from performance reviews to organisational design. We create roles, assign headcount, build reporting structures — all anchored to the assumption that a person's capacity is bounded by the hours in their week and the weeks in their year. Need more output? Hire more people. Need it faster? Ask them to work overtime. The levers are straightforward, if expensive.

It's a model that rewards busyness, sometimes more than results. And it has a hard ceiling: no employee can work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across multiple tasks simultaneously. Humans are extraordinary — but they are not infinitely scalable.

## The Agent Model: Value as a Function of Outcomes

Agentic AI flips this on its head.

An AI agent doesn't have a salary. It doesn't work 40 hours a week. It doesn't take sick days, need onboarding, or require a performance improvement plan. It can run 24/7, spin up multiple instances of itself simultaneously, and scale from handling ten tasks to ten thousand without a single additional hire.

But here's the critical insight that most executives haven't yet internalised: **the cost of an AI agent is not a function of time. It's a function of the outcome it produces.**

Consider two very different agents.

A customer service chatbot running on an open-source language model can handle thousands of enquiries per day at near-zero marginal cost. Once built and deployed, each additional conversation costs fractions of a cent. The economics are extraordinary — scale is virtually unlimited, and the incremental cost per outcome approaches zero.

Now consider an AI agent that generates professional marketing videos for property listings. Each output requires significant computational resources: rendering, processing, and generation through large multimodal models. The cost per outcome might be $2, $5, or even $15 per video. Still far cheaper than a human videographer, but a meaningfully different cost profile from the chatbot.

This is the paradigm shift. We're no longer asking "How many hours did this cost us?" We're asking **"What did this outcome cost, and what value did it create?"**

## The New Economics: Cost Per Outcome

In the traditional model, if you want to understand the economics of your marketing team, you look at headcount, salaries, and hours worked. In the agentic model, you look at the cost of each deliverable: each social media post generated, each listing description written, each lead responded to, each market report compiled.

This creates a fundamentally different optimisation problem for leaders. Instead of managing utilisation rates and billable hours, you're managing a portfolio of AI capabilities, each with its own cost-per-outcome profile. Some agents are nearly free to run at scale. Others are expensive per unit but still dramatically more efficient than the human alternative. And the best strategies will combine both, deploying the right agent at the right cost point for the right task.

Think of it as moving from a payroll model to something closer to a usage-based model — but one where usage is measured in outcomes delivered, not time consumed.

To make this concrete, here's how the mental model shifts:

| | **Employee Model** | **Agent Model** |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost basis** | Annual salary / hourly rate | Cost per outcome produced |
| **Capacity** | ~40 hours/week, one task at a time | 24/7, unlimited parallel instances |
| **Scaling** | Hire more people (weeks/months) | Spin up more instances (seconds) |
| **Efficiency metric** | Output per hour worked | Value created per dollar spent |
| **Optimisation lever** | Utilisation and productivity | Workflow design and model selection |

The leaders who understand this table — who can look at a business process and instinctively think in cost-per-outcome rather than headcount — will have a significant strategic advantage in the years ahead.

## Working Alongside, Not Instead Of

I want to be clear about something: this is not a story about replacing people.

At The Agency, where we support nearly 400 agents and 900 staff with AI-powered tools and workflows, the goal has never been elimination. It's augmentation.

The most powerful configurations we've built are those where AI agents and human professionals work in concert. An AI agent handles the high-volume, repeatable work — parsing data, generating first drafts, responding to routine enquiries, monitoring market movements — while the human focuses on what humans do best: building relationships, exercising judgment, navigating nuance, and providing the kind of strategic advice that only comes from experience and empathy.

In real estate, this means our agents are evolving from information gatekeepers to strategic advisors. When a buyer can get property data, suburb profiles, and market comparisons from an AI in seconds, the value of the human agent isn't in having access to information — it's in knowing what to do with it. It's in reading the room during a negotiation. It's in understanding that a family isn't just buying a house, they're choosing a neighbourhood for their kids to grow up in.

The AI handles the data. The human handles the relationship. Together, they deliver something neither could achieve alone.

## What This Means for Executive Leadership

If you're sitting in a boardroom or a leadership meeting, here's what I'd challenge you to start thinking about.

**Reframe your budgeting.** Stop thinking purely in terms of headcount and start modelling cost-per-outcome for the tasks your teams perform. Which of those tasks could an AI agent handle? At what cost? And what does your team look like when the repetitive work is handled by agents and your people are freed up for higher-value activities?

**Build measurement frameworks for agent performance.** Just as you track employee KPIs, you need dashboards that monitor your AI agents' cost per outcome, quality, throughput, and reliability. This isn't a set-and-forget exercise. Agent economics shift as models improve, costs change, and new capabilities emerge. Continuous monitoring is essential.

**Invest in orchestration.** The real competitive advantage isn't in having one clever chatbot. It's in building an orchestration layer that coordinates multiple AI agents — each specialised for different tasks — working together as a cohesive system alongside your human team. This is where the compounding returns emerge. A single agent automates a task. An orchestrated system of agents transforms a business.

**Lead the cultural shift.** Your people need to understand that AI agents are tools that amplify their capabilities, not threats to their livelihoods. The organisations that get this cultural piece right will attract and retain the best talent — people who are excited to work with AI, not anxious about being replaced by it.

## The Opportunity Is Now

We are in the early innings of what I believe will be the most significant transformation in how businesses operate since the internet. The shift from time-based to outcome-based economics isn't a theoretical exercise — it's happening right now, in real companies, producing real results.

At The Agency, we're already seeing it: AI agents processing hundreds of thousands of data events monthly, automating workflows that used to consume entire teams' time, and enabling our people to focus on the work that truly matters. The cost savings are significant, but the real story is the value creation — better service, faster response times, deeper market insights, and agents who can focus on being the trusted advisors their clients need.

The leaders who embrace this shift — who learn to think in outcomes rather than hours, who build the measurement systems to optimise agent performance, and who create cultures where humans and AI thrive together — will define the next era of business.

The question isn't whether this transformation is coming. It's whether you'll be leading it or catching up to it.

## SLIDE 1: Title

**Toucan Ops**

Project management for teams that include AI.

*Your ambition + Our AI expertise. Two can do this.*

---

## SLIDE 2: The Shift Nobody's Tooled For

Your team just changed.

It used to be 10 people and a project board. Now it's 6 people, 4 AI agents, and a project board that wasn't built for any of this.

Every business is becoming a hybrid team — humans and AI agents working side by side. But the tools haven't caught up.

> *"44% of leaders expect AI agents to take lead roles in managing specific projects alongside human teams within 2–3 years."*
> — KPMG Q4 AI Pulse Survey, January 2026

---

## SLIDE 3: The Problem

**Project management broke when AI agents joined the team.**

Traditional PM tools were built for humans who read emails, attend standups, and update their own status. AI agents don't do any of that. They work in seconds, not sprints. They don't get tired but they do get confused. They're cheap to run but expensive when they go wrong.

The result? Businesses are running AI agents with no visibility into what they're doing, what they cost, or whether they're actually delivering.

Three things are failing right now:

**No way to manage AI work alongside human work.** Your project board shows what Sarah did this week. It has no idea what your AI research agent produced overnight.

**No way to measure AI agent performance.** How much did that task cost? Was the output good? Should the agent be retrained or replaced? Nobody knows.

**No governance for AI decisions.** An AI agent just sent a draft to your client. Who approved it? What was the reasoning? Where's the audit trail?

---

## SLIDE 4: The Market Is Feeling This

This isn't a niche problem. It's the gap in every business adopting AI.

**41%** of project managers say AI adoption is their top challenge (Capterra, 2025)

**39%** report a lack of AI skills on staff

**95%** of AI pilots fail — most because there was no operational structure around the agents (Motion, 2025)

**75%+** of PMOs are now using or piloting AI-powered tools, but bolting AI onto human-only workflows (Gartner / Gold Standard, 2026)

> *"80% of project managers' work will be eliminated by 2030 because of AI"*
> — Gartner

The work isn't disappearing. It's transforming. Someone needs to build the operations layer for this new reality.

That's us.

---

## SLIDE 5: Introducing Toucan Ops

**The operations platform for hybrid human-AI teams.**

Toucan Ops is project management rebuilt from scratch for businesses that run AI agents alongside people. Not a chatbot. Not another AI assistant. An actual operations layer where work happens, gets tracked, and gets done — whether the worker is human or artificial.

**Three things make us different:**

**1. Project-first, not chat-first.**
Your dashboard shows projects, not conversations. AI agents work in the background. You see summaries, approve decisions, and review outputs — like managing a team, not typing prompts.

**2. Built-in AI Project Manager.**
An AI orchestrator watches your projects, breaks goals into tasks, assigns work to the right agent (or person), tracks costs per execution, and escalates when something needs a human brain. It's the PM that never sleeps.

**3. Full cost and performance visibility.**
Every AI execution logs its token usage, model cost, tool calls, and outcome. You know exactly what your AI team costs and what it delivers. Per task. Per project. Per agent. In real time.

---

## SLIDE 6: How It Works

**You set the goal. Toucan runs the operation.**

```
You create a project → "Onboard Acme Corp as a client"
    ↓
The AI orchestrator decomposes it into tasks
    ↓
Tasks get assigned to AI agents or flagged for humans
    ↓
Agents work in the background (research, draft, analyse)
    ↓
Results surface for human review at decision points
    ↓
Project progresses. Costs tracked. Audit trail complete.
```

**What your dashboard looks like:**

- Active projects with real-time status (running / needs attention / complete)
- "Needs Your Attention" queue — only the decisions that require a human
- Cost tracking per project, per agent, per model
- Agent performance metrics — which agents deliver, which need tuning
- Full execution history with reasoning and outputs

**What you don't do:**

- Write prompts
- Babysit agents
- Manually coordinate between AI tools
- Wonder what happened or what it cost

---

## SLIDE 7: The AI Project Manager

**Meet your new operations lead.**

The Toucan orchestrator is a purpose-built AI project manager that runs continuously in the background. It's not a chatbot you talk to — it's an operational brain that manages your AI workforce.

**What it does:**

**Decomposes goals into tasks** — Give it a project brief, it breaks it into actionable steps with dependencies, priorities, and assignments.

**Assigns intelligently** — Routes tasks to the best available agent based on capability, cost, and past performance. Flags tasks that need human judgment.

**Tracks everything** — Every execution logs tokens, cost, model used, time taken, and outcome quality. Rolls up to project and portfolio views.

**Escalates at the right moment** — Doesn't interrupt you for things it can handle. Surfaces decisions that genuinely need your expertise. Learns your approval patterns over time.

**Self-improves** — Creates new agents when it identifies capability gaps. Adjusts agent prompts based on output quality. Recommends workflow optimisations.

**Manages budgets** — Enforces cost ceilings per project, per agent, per execution. Alerts before overruns. Suggests cheaper model alternatives when appropriate.

---

## SLIDE 8: For Service Businesses Specifically

**We know your workflows because we built this for you.**

Service businesses — agencies, consultancies, professional services firms — are adopting AI faster than anyone. But they face unique challenges:

**Client-facing work has zero margin for error.** An AI agent that sends a dodgy email to your client can cost you the relationship. You need approval workflows, not autonomous chaos.

**Time is literally money.** Billable hours, project margins, resource utilisation — your PM tools need to track AI work with the same rigour as human work. What did this agent cost on the Acme project?

**Tribal knowledge is your moat.** Your best processes live in people's heads. AI agents need that context to be useful. We help capture it, structure it, and feed it to your agents.

**You're already managing projects.** You don't need another tool — you need your existing project management approach to evolve for a hybrid team.

**Target: 200–2,000 employees.** Big enough to benefit from AI agents. Small enough that a platform failure hurts. The sweet spot where Toucan Ops delivers the most value.

---

## SLIDE 9: Two Phases. One Partnership.

**First, we get you set up right. Then, we grow with you.**

**Phase 1: Consulting & Implementation** (4–8 weeks)

We work alongside your team to:
- Map your current processes and identify the highest-value automation opportunities
- Configure your AI agents with your brand voice, knowledge, and approval workflows
- Set up your first 2–3 projects with trained agents producing real outputs
- Establish governance: who approves what, cost limits, quality thresholds
- Deliver quick wins that prove the ROI before you've finished your first quarterly review

**Phase 2: Platform & Scale** (ongoing)

Your Toucan Ops platform runs your AI operations while you focus on clients:
- AI orchestrator manages your growing agent workforce
- New use cases added as your team gains confidence
- Performance dashboards show exactly what's working
- Costs stay visible and controlled as you scale
- Our team stays available for optimisation and expansion

**Why two phases?**

Because 95% of AI pilots fail when businesses get software without strategy. We're the only platform that pairs expert implementation with an autonomous operations layer. That's not a feature — it's why our clients succeed.

---

## SLIDE 10: What Exists vs What Doesn't

**Nobody else is building this.**

| What the market offers | What's missing |
|---|---|
| AI chatbots (Lindy, Sintra, Marblism) | Project-based operations for AI teams |
| Human PM tools with "AI features" (Monday, Asana) | PM tools that treat AI agents as first-class team members |
| Agent builders (Relevance AI, n8n) | Orchestration layer that manages agents like employees |
| AI scheduling (Motion) | Cost tracking and performance measurement per AI execution |
| Prompt libraries and templates | Governance and approval workflows for AI outputs |

**The gap is operational.** Everyone's building AI workers. Nobody's building the management layer to run them.

That's Toucan Ops.

---

## SLIDE 11: Competitive Landscape

**Well-funded competitors. None in our lane.**

| Company | Raised | What They Do | What They Don't Do |

## SLIDE 17: Why Now

**Five reasons this moment matters.**

**1. The hybrid workforce is here — management isn't.**
Every business is adding AI agents. Nobody's built the operations layer. First mover in this category owns it.

**2. 95% of AI pilots are failing.**
Not because the AI doesn't work — because there's no operational structure around it. We're the fix, not another experiment.

**3. BPO is desperate for AI — and nobody's offering white-label.**
$261 billion market. Zero competitors with a white-label model. One partnership could deliver thousands of customers.

**4. AI costs are falling. Unit economics are unlocking.**
Running agent-based platforms for SMEs was uneconomical 18 months ago. It's viable now and improving every quarter.

**5. Service businesses are underserved by horizontal platforms.**
Every competitor targets "all SMBs." Nobody owns the service business vertical — the exact businesses with the most project-based AI work to manage.

---

## SLIDE 18: The Vision

**Where this goes.**

**Year 1:** Prove the model. 10+ service business clients. Validated consulting + SaaS unit economics. First BPO partnership.

**Year 2:** Scale the platform. 50+ direct clients. 3+ BPO partners. Vertical expansion from agencies into consulting, legal, accounting. SOC 2 Type II certified.

**Year 3:** Category leader. "AI operations for service businesses" is a recognised category and Toucan Ops defines it. 500+ clients across direct and BPO channels. International expansion.

**The end state:** Every service business that runs AI agents uses Toucan Ops to manage them. We're the operating system for the hybrid workforce.

---

## SLIDE 19: Close

**Two can do this.**

Your business is already building a hybrid team. The question isn't whether AI agents will be part of your operations — it's whether you'll have the tools to manage them properly.

We're building those tools. And we'd love you to join us.
